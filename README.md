<h1>Hirst Painting Project</h1>

The Hirst Painting Project is a Python program that generates artwork inspired by the iconic "Hirst Spot Painting" series. This project uses the Turtle graphics library to create a digital version of this famous artwork style. The program generates colorful spot paintings using randomly selected colors and positions, resulting in a visually stunning output.

The project was done as part of the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) - Day 18.
